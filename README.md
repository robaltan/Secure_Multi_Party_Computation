The main goal of using a multi-party protocol is to make sure that shared calculations could be carried out to get an output while making sure that every party’s inputs remain private. A classical example that motivates the implemen- tation of multi-party computation is the millionaire’s problem, where multiple parties would aspire to learn who is the wealthiest among themselves without revealing their wealth to one another.
